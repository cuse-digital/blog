<h2>Week 1 in Review</h2>
<h4>Location: Frazer Pre-K-8 </h4>
<h4>Date: August 1 - 4th, 2022</h4>
<p>Grade 3 Summary: </p>
<p>We are grade 3 students attending summer school at Frazer and we took part in the AT&T Digital Literacy Experience.  On the first day, we talked about the importance of proper form in typing. We used an online site to learn how to keep our fingers in the proper place on the keyboard and type with our 8 fingers instead of one.  We were told that it would be hard and might make typing slower, but once we got better at it, it would make us faster at typing.  Later that day, we talked about the difference between personal and private information and which type was safe to share online and which was not safe.  We were given lots of examples of information and we had to say if it was personal or private.  We got all of them right! </p>
<p>We learned that computers store information using two options - on and off - and this is called binary.  We then made bracelets which had the first letter of our first name in binary.  The next day we discussed cyberbullying and what it means and what to do if it happens.  We learned what the word upstander means and how to be one.  Later that afternoon we learned what coding is and how important it is for us to learn how to code.  We used a site called Scratch to make our first project. It was awesome!
On the last day, we made our second project in Scratch and then we worked in groups to complete a Lego challenge. 
  I liked working on the typing challenge and learning how to make my own projects in Scratch. </p> 
<p> When I am online, I will try to treat people the way that I would want to be treated. </p>

<p>Grade 4-5 Summary: </p>
<p>We are students in grades 4 and 5 attending summer school at Frazer and we took part in the AT&T Digital Literacy Experience. We did many of the same activities as the ones covered in Grade 3. But for each activity we applied it to a real world skill. For example, to practice our typing skills we had to type the HTML code to write our Bio's for this website. It was very fussy and at first we made a lot of mistakes. But each day we got a little better. </p>
<p>We were surprised by what we learned related to digital presence on the internet and privacy. We learned that just because we delete a photo from our phone that it doesn't really go away. Others might share it or take a screen shot. And websites like SnapChat and Facebook keep their own copies. We also learned about
ClickBait and what type of personal information we will give out to others on the internet. Coding a game with a scoreboard using Scratch was really fun. </p> 
<p> When we are online, we will think carefully about what sites we visit and what information we share. </p>
