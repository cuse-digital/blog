<h2>Week 2 in Review</h2>
<h4>Location: Bellevue Elementary School </h4>
<h4>Date: August 8 - 12th, 2022</h4>
<p>Grade 3 Summary: </p>
<p>We are grade 3 students at Bellevue summer school and every afternoon we went to the library to learn about digital literacy.  We practiced typing and tried hard to keep our fingers on the keys and sit up straight when we typed.  Each day, we did some typing to warm up our fingers and practice typing different letters.  We learned what the difference is between private and personal information and which one is safe to share and which one is not. We talked about passwords and how to make a password that is strong and that we only share with our parents.</p>
<p>We saw that computers store information using two options, on and off, and then we made our own bracelets using beads that showed the first letter of our first name in binary.  We were allowed to even make a second bracelet with the first letter of our last name!  </p> 
<p> The next day we talked about cyberbullying and we all shared our thoughts about why it occurs and what we should do if it happens.  We also learned what the word 'upstander' means and saw examples and videos of how we can be an upstander.  We saw a video of how a digital citizen acts and then we got to draw a picture of what a digital citizen superhero looks like. We shared our pictures with our classroom teacher and each other.  Later that afternoon we talked about coding and what it is.  We pretended the teacher was a robot and had to give her instructions on how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich - it was hard to give instructions that a robot could understand.  We made our first Scratch project and got to show it to each other.  Coding was really fun!
We saw a video on what the term 'digital footprint' means and did some activities to see how different words and emoji's can be hard to interpret online.  We saw a video of a student playing video games online and then a new player came online and started saying mean things to the player.  We practiced saying the rule STOP when this happens.  S - step away; T - tell a trusted adult; O - Ok sites first; P - pause and think online.  I will try to remember this when I play games online. </p>
<p>We then talked about a new word which is 'clickbait' - we saw several headlines and had to decide if we would click on it or not.  We discovered 3 rules we should think about before clicking on something and these will help us to not click on links that may have a virus or ask us to buy something.  </p>
<p> On the last day, we got to play with the Makey Makey kits and make connections with our computer and the invention kits.  We learned what an open and closed circuit is and how some things conduct electricity. </p>

<p>Grade 4-5 Summary: </p>
<p>We are students in grades 4 and 5 attending summer school at Bellevue Elementary School and we took part in the AT&T Digital Literacy Experience. We did many of the same activities as the ones covered in Grade 3. But for each activity we applied it to a real world skill. For example, to practice our typing skills we had to type the HTML code to write our Bio's for this website. It was very fussy and at first we made a lot of mistakes. But each day we got a little better. </p>
<p>We were really surprised to realize that our new skills can be used in almost every career we could think of! We couldn't think of one job that didn't use information and technology skills. </p> 
<p>We learned how important good verbal communication skills are by playing a LEGO game where we had to describe the shape of what they needed to build. But they didn't see the shape first and the communication person couldn't touch any of the pieces. It was fun and frustrating but we all were able to complete the puzzle. </p>
